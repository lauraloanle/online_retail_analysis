Goal: Exploring customer segmentation and customer lifetime value for sales forecasting

# Background

A UK-based company that supplies unique all-occasion gifts, such as themed dishware and trendy household items, takes pride in offering an unparalleled selection of carefully curated products designed to enhance every special moment. With over 1 million transactions realized between 2009 and 2011, this company provides products for wholesalers, retail stores, or resellers. This means it sells to sales channel partners and stores that are looking for unique gift ideas and products for their customers. As a product supplier for wholesale stores, the company deals with cancellations and bulk orders. Due to the nature of the gift-giving product category, the volume of business is high during peak holiday seasons, which in the UK occur from October to December.

The challenge is to better understand the customer data available and historical sales, to identify an opportunity to build targeted segments to market and to forecast sales.

Another key factor to keep in mind is that the analysis also considers cancellations and returns, so the segmentation approach should identify customer groups who are qualified customers who generally donâ€™t show indicators of returning or canceling their orders. A key goal in retail is to ensure profitable sales that minimize returns and cancellations, which impacts the profitability of the organization.
