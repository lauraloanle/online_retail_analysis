# Online Retail Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to delve into customer segmentation and customer lifetime value to make precise sales forecasts for a UK-based company that specializes in unique all-occasion gifts.

## Company Overview
The company, boasting an array of themed dishware and contemporary household items, is distinguished by its commitment to providing exclusively curated products that amplify every special occasion. With transactions surpassing 1 million between 2009 and 2011, it primarily caters to wholesalers, retailers, or resellers. Essentially, they function as a supplier for businesses seeking distinctive gift items for their clientele. While dealing with bulk orders and occasional cancellations, a notable surge in business volume is observed during the UK's peak holiday seasons, spanning from October to December.

## Challenge
The primary objective is to harness the potential of existing customer data and historical sales records. By doing so, the goal is to unearth opportunities for creating targeted market segments and enhancing sales forecasts. An important aspect to consider is the cancellations and returns; therefore, the segmentation strategy should earmark customers who exhibit minimal tendencies for returns or cancellations. Maximizing profitable sales while mitigating returns and cancellations is pivotal for the company's profitability.
